This is an Arduino Sketch that controls a bunch LEDs attached to a dress. The
LEDs came from a NeoPixel strip that we then cut up and soldered into a string.
The LEDs were then sewn into specific places on a friend's dress.

My friend was attending a ball that had the theme of stars and constellations.
She wanted to make her dress light up with RGB LEDs to act as stars. Among the
28 stars, seven of them formed the Big Dipper constellation on the front of her
dress. She wanted the Big Dipper to act differently and stand out.

21 of the stars are lightly magenta in color and twinkle randomly. The seven
stars that form the Big Dipper scroll through a gradient of three colors
continuously. Rather than calculate the values of each step in the gradient as
the program runs, a lookup table is used instead.

The Sketch requires the NeoPixel Arduino library from Adafruit.
